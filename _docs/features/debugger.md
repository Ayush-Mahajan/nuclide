One of the key features of Nuclide is its multiple-language debugging support. The Nuclide debugger
is provided within the familiar [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) interface.

The Nuclide debugger provides many capabilities allowing you to have a productive debug loop,
including inspection and watches, setting breakpoints, step in/over/out, etc.

## Instantiation

In general, the debugger is instantiated via `cmd-shift-Y` (`ctrl-shift-Y` on Linux). You can also
toggle the debugger through the [command palette](/docs/editor/basics/#command-palette) and the
Nuclide toolbar.

## Basics

Nuclide supports debugging for [multiple languages](#language-specific-debugging). However,
there are some basic debugging concepts that apply across all languages.

## Language Specific Debugging

While the [general process](#basics) for debugging in Nuclide is similar, it is useful to discuss
and illustrate platform and language specific debugging workflows.
