Nuclide is a code editor built on the backbone of [GitHub's Atom text editor](https://atom.io).
Like other code editors and IDEs, there is a familiar look and feel to Nuclide. On the left-hand
side is your project tree, which includes associated files and folders. On the right-hand side is
the main editor that contains the code and text for files in your project. And on the bottom is a
status bar providing quick-look information such as errors, the path of the current file relative
to your project root, the type of file that is open, and other context-aware data.
